CSCI 4370 Project 2

IMPORTANT!:
I was unsure of how you would be grading our project. Our project utilizes a 
text-based User Interface (Compile and Run Querry.java). I've also included 
the MyQueries.sql file if you choose to test the files that way. For our 
project you will need to update the database, user, and password variables 
(Lines 21, 25, and 29) inside Querry.java in order for the JDBC to connect 
to MySQL.

If you have any trouble running (ex: can't connect to MySQL with JDBC), I am 
more than happy to come to office hours and demo the project.
